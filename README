This my implementation of the exercices of the course :
Mastering RTOS: Hands on FreeRTOS and STM32Fx with Debugging on Udemy on Udemy 
(https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-rtos-hands-on-with-freertos-arduino-and-stm32fx/)

I use the STM32L5 with the Nucleo-L55ZE development board (instead of STM32F4)
